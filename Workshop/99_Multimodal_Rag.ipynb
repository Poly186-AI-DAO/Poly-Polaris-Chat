The R&D expenses for these years are as follows:\\n\\n- 2021: $500,000\\n- 2022: $560,000\\n- 2023: $620,000\\n\\nThese figures are provided in the R&D Costs Chart on page 18 of the 'minion-tech.pdf' document. To estimate the R&D expense for the missing year 2020, we can observe the trend of the R&D expenses over the years provided. There is a consistent increase of $60,000 per year from 2021 to 2023. Using this trend, we can extrapolate the R&D expense for 2020 by subtracting $60,000 from the 2021 figure, which would give us an estimated expense of $440,000 for 2020.\\n\\nNow, we can sum up the expenses to get the total R&D expense from 2020 to 2023:\\n\\n- 2020: $440,000 (estimated)\\n- 2021: $500,000\\n- 2022: $560,000\\n- 2023: $620,000\\n\\nTotal R&D expense = $440,000 + $500,000 + $560,000 + $620,000 = $2,120,000\\n\\nIn millions, this is $2.12 million.
